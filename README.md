# loaner

Loaner is a *non-trivial* toy project for learning Functional Programming. 

The goal of loaner is to provide a realistic domain model with a wider breadth of use cases in which to explore functional programming. It follows a somewhat typical enterprise business domain--handling payments on accounts--including the application of relatively complex business rules, interactions with backend services, a UI component, as well automated, batched processes.
